## üìå Overview
This project implements state-of-the-art **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** for high-quality image generation. It supports multiple architectures (DCGAN, WGAN, cGAN) and is designed for both research and practical applications in synthetic data creation.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Multiple GAN Architectures**:
  - DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
  - WGAN/WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty)
  - Conditional GAN (cGAN) for label-controlled generation
- **Pre-trained Models** for quick inference
- **Custom Dataset Support** (train on your own images)
- **Training Metrics** (Inception Score, FID)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for visualization

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GAN-Image-Generator.git
cd GAN-Image-Generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
